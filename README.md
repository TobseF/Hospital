 ### ðŸ“– About
 This is one of my first software projects and my first computer game.
 I uploaded it also as a reminder... that I also started very, very simply and wrote horrible code.
 But I was very proud of it, and it was a magic moment seeing others playing my game.
 With exactly 600 lines of code (including imports & JDoc) it's even my shortest game.
 And it doesn't use any graphics. 

 The game play blueprint is the Nintendo _Game & Watch_ Video Game **Fireman** from 1980. 
 It was a monochrome single game handheld gaming device. I never owned an original, but the game
 was included in the Nintendo Game Box Game _Game & Watch Gallery_ from 1997

 ### ðŸ’» System Requirements
 To start, the game needs an installed [Java JRE](https://www.java.com/en/download).
 The game was developed in Java 1.4 and should even run with 1.1.
 To launch it in an IDE run `hospital.game.main`
